# Explaining-Spatio-Temporal-Clustering-with-ClAMP

This research explores how Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance the interpretability of clustering algorithms, focusing on spatio-temporal data. The project adapts the Cluster Analysis with Multidimensional Prototypes (ClAMP) framework to a real-world mobility dataset (Hofer LandBus) to make clustering results explainable through human-readable rules.
